# Hobbies socail app
**Hobbies socail app** is a social media site that aims to connect people with same hobbies and share and learn some
skills, It could be a good way to learn and explore a new hobby and create some new friends
What are the problems that Hobbies is trying to solve?
**1- Some people want to learn a new hobby, but they don't know how to start**
**2- Connect people with the same interests so they learn and improve from each other**
**3- Solving the boredom problem that some people face specially if they have free time (This problem is
increased this year due to covid-19 pandemic)**
## How we are going to do that?
Hobbies will have multiple hobby categories to choose from, the user will have the chance to join any
desired community
every hobby has it's own part in the site and there will be multiple a activities that the user could do, like
sharing some blogs or videos and creating or enrolling in courses and also follow some people from that
hobby category
Why we consider Hobbies innovative?
currently there are no social media site that offers all what we are offering
Twitch.tv offers similar functionality but not all of them, and twitch focuses more on video games not on
hobbies
Skill Share is a site that market it self as an online learning community, but the site is focusing just on selling
courses not on creating a connection between community members
having one site with all of this functionality will attract some hobby communities to try our site
Thanks
